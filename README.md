# CP1404 Assignment 2: Travel Tracker 2.0 by YOURNAME
# I was mostly a noob here and had not really grasped python that much. Check traveltracker part 1 for the updated code.
_Edit this README, replacing this line and above with your own name/details._  
_At the end of the project, complete the project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the ... parts)._
_Note that to get high marks for this, your reflection should match the "exemplary" description from the rubric:_

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
one and a half weeks
Note: You may like to use the WakaTime plugin, which tracks exactly how long you spend in code. See http://wakatime.com (but note that the free version only has a 7-day history)

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
Am most satisfied with the fact that I can form classes to be used in Kivy.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
The fact that I was not able to finish my Kivy app code.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
I believe the Place class I formed worked really well in the first part of assignment
as well as using it in the PlaceCollection class.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
I will definitely start way more earlier than this time. I will also finish coding all the classes
before touching the main codes.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
I really used the kivy demos to help me create all my kivy codes. Lecture notes
for both my classes and kivy  especially the attrgetter method.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
I was not aware of the string and list properties in Kivy, so I had to create constructors in init.
This made it impossible for any of my kivy codes to work till I saw their 
use in the kivy demos on how to store them as variables.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
Classes highly reduces the time of searching a certain part of a code from the main code.
It greatly reduces the amount of code one needs to enter as well making your codes look neat.
